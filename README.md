# Sign-Language-Interpreter-using-CNN
Developed an application that translates hand gestures captured through a webcam to plain text, which can help in realtime communication by using deep learning. To implement, we used the OpenCV library in order to produce our
dataset. In our method, the processed image is passed to the Convolutional Neural Network model for prediction and if a hand gesture is detected then the letter is printed
